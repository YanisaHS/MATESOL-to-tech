# MA in TESOL/Applied Linguistics to Tech

This guide contains general information on learning to code, basic tech knowledge/skills, and potential industry job paths. I originally wrote this for current or former MA in TESOL/Applied Linguistics students at the University of Alabama, which I graduated from in May 2021 (Roll Tide!). If others find it helpful, great! But, the information below is based on my own opinions/experience with a TESOL and Applied Linguistics background.

## About Me

I‚Äôm a self-taught tech queen üëë¬†who graduated from the [University of Alabama‚Äôs MA in TESOL/Applied Linguistics](https://linguistics.english.ua.edu/) program in May 2021. I work in industry now, although I did have a brief (and extremely low-paid) stint in a PhD program, where I was a research assistant in a NLP lab. I‚Äôm currently a technical writer for an advertising management, intelligence, and analytics company, and I also freelance AI/ML coding tutorials and technical guides for a cloud computing company. Feel free to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanisahaley/) if you‚Äôre interested in knowing more about my experience!

Disclaimer: I do not have a computer science background.

## Questions to Consider

### Why should I learn to code or learn new tech skills?

Coding skills are valuable in many research/academia and industry careers, and they‚Äôre transferrable across multiple job areas. Industry jobs in tech also generally have good pay and opportunities for career growth, and there‚Äôs a large variety of career paths. Plus, it‚Äôs super interesting! Many tech companies also value curious individuals who love learning, so it‚Äôs a good culture fit if transitioning from academia.

### What‚Äôs the difference between learning a natural language versus a programming language?

EVERYTHING! Just kidding. Kind of. 

I believe calling programming languages ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù is more of a lack-of-a-better-term situation. While natural and programming languages share some similarities (e.g., both have syntax, both are used for communication), they are also very different. Programming languages are stricter than natural languages and do not allow for ambiguity, since natural languages can resolve many ambiguities with context. You must be precise when programming, because your machine will not be able to resolve any confusion on its own.

Additionally, we use natural and programming languages differently. Programming languages, obviously, don‚Äôt have speaking and listening components. It‚Äôs also extremely common to look up strategies, solutions, and reuse code found online, even for advanced programmers. Personally, I think coding is more similar to puzzle-solving than it is to learning a natural language. I also found learning to code much easier than learning a natural language.

### What language should I learn first?

PYTHON! 100% Python. I don‚Äôt trust people who recommend other languages first and neither should you. 

*Note: As I stated before, this article is for those with a similar background as me who are considering learning some basic tech skills for careers in academia or transitioning into the tech industry. If you somehow found this but are interested in being a web developer or something else like that, you might want to learn Javascript first and also stop reading this article.*

### Why should I learn Python?

As an educator, I believe the main advantage of learning Python first is simply that it‚Äôs wildly popular, so it has the most learning resources available online. Additionally, it‚Äôs a good general purpose language without too much overhead and a relatively intuitive structure, and you can learn other languages (e.g., R, Java) later if needed.

### Learning to program is HARD, should I keep going?

I can‚Äôt answer that for you as this completely depends on you and your career goals. However, I personally believe sticking with it long enough to at least get a basic understanding of programming and the ability to write short scripts will help tremendously in your industry or academic pursuits. There are many jobs which only want basic familiarity with programming languages or other tech skills. Also, having some coding knowledge may help you stand out from other candidates for tech jobs which don‚Äôt require coding abilities.

Additionally, learning to code has a significant learning curve. The beginning was hard for me too. I was probably coding for at least a year before I felt ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with it, and even now I‚Äôm constantly learning something new. Try not to be too hard on yourself.

## Learning Resources

### How I learned to code

Below are the steps I personally took to learn how to code. Keep in mind this would have been in 2018-2019, and there are many more learning resources available now. I don‚Äôt necessarily recommend this exact learning path, since you may have different goals and there have been many advancements in NLP and the tech industry since 2018. However, I do recommend working on personal projects once you‚Äôve learned the basics of Python as this is the best way to learn how to solve problems and trouble-shoot your code.

1. **[Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)** (chapters 1-6)
    
    This free online textbook is a great resource for learning Python, although it‚Äôs centered on using Python for administrative tasks (i.e., ‚Äúboring stuff‚Äù), so I only went through the first six chapters to learn the fundamentals of Python.
    
2. **[Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Online Textbook](http://www.nltk.org/book/)** (chapters 1-5)
    
    This is also a free online textbook which is about using Python for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is an older textbook and should not be used as a comprehensive resource for learning NLP; however, it still has a lot of good information if you are new to Python and NLP.
    
3. **[Advanced NLP with spaCy](https://course.spacy.io/en)**
    
    This course is designed to be functional for beginners, although I think it would be a bit difficult for a true beginner to Python.
    
4. **Work on personal projects**
    
    I used to practice by making up random personal projects to work on. For example, I downloaded the text for Anna Karenina (my favorite book!) and practiced writing scripts that would count the number of times Tolstoy mentioned each character, investigate which words Tolstoy used to describe each character, etc., and compared it with my knowledge of the plot of Anna Karenina. I also practiced [web scraping](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/) for data collection and analysis, and for every research project I did during my MA, I tried to choose a topic that would further my own coding abilities. Working on your own projects is an important step in your coding journey as it helps you learn to code independently, read documentation, and trouble-shoot your own code.

### Paid resources

- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)*
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog)*
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- Courses through universities or community colleges
- Bootcamps (I am very hesitant to recommend these, but they do exist and work out for some people)

**If you have some money to spend, I recommend these two the most for beginners because they use web-based code editors, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about setting up your environment locally (e.g., downloading Python, setting up your code editor, trouble-shooting various environment issues). I have not used Codecademy‚Äôs paid courses, but I have gone through some from DataCamp and they‚Äôre very good.*

## Relevant Languages, Tools, and More

I‚Äôve included some items you may see on job postings. Although I‚Äôve tried to organize them logically and include brief explanations, I still encourage you to do your own reading on any of these as they relate to your career goals and job applications.

### Languages

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R, Java, Javascript, Ruby, C#, SQL
    
    These are common programming languages. I‚Äôve included SQL, although SQL differs from the other languages listed because it is technically a ‚Äúquery language,‚Äù and is used to make detailed queries into a database. You‚Äôll likely need to know SQL if you plan to work as a data analyst or data scientist.
    
- **Other Languages**: HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, YAML
    
    These languages are not ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù languages because they‚Äôre used to define and structure data rather than manipulate data. These are quite a bit easier to learn than programming languages, and there are a lot of jobs that prefer candidates with basic understanding of HTML.
    
- **Shell Scripting**: Bash, PowerShell
    
    Shell scripts are run directly against your machine‚Äôs operating system, and they can directly run operating system commands. You probably won‚Äôt need this, but just in case.
    

### Tools and more

- **General:** Command Line, Linux Terminal
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Code Editors:** Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, Google CoLab
- **Methodologies:** Agile
- **Project Management, DevOps, or Miscellaneous:** Jira, Confluence, Asana, Markdown

## Potential Industry Job Paths

This list is not exhaustive, but I‚Äôve listed some potential job titles which you may find helpful as you consider industry careers. I am not an expert on these job paths, but they are potential careers which may be appealing to those looking to work in tech, but with backgrounds in education, applied linguistics, and TESOL. If you‚Äôre interested in any of these careers, I recommend you look at many different job postings before you‚Äôre on the job market to get an idea of what skills they require or prefer.

- **Related tech careers:** Technical Curriculum Developer/Architect, Curriculum Manager, Content Developer, Content/Information Architect, Technical Writer, Technical Trainer, Technical Project Manager, UX Researcher, Learning Architect, Learning and Development Consultant/Lead, Data Annotator, Linguist, Analytical Linguist, Computational Linguist, Language Engineer (specifically at Amazon)
- **Very technical, but related:** Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, NLP or ML Engineer, Conversational AI Architect/Engineer
    
    These careers generally require an advanced knowledge of coding and surrounding technologies, and they will almost always require a coding interview (i.e., you have to code in front of the interviewer).
    
- **Still technical, but less related:** Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Analyst, Web Developer/Front-End Engineer, Operations Analyst
    
    These careers are also quite technical and are less related to education, linguistics, or research. However, if you find yourself gravitating toward the technical side, I believe these job titles are a bit easier to break into without a formal computer science or technical background.
    

### How do I find jobs?

LINKEDIN! I highly recommend you use LinkedIn to find jobs and track your job applications. It‚Äôs a great resource because your online resume is right there (keep your profile updated!), and in my experience, it does well with suggesting related jobs based on your online profile and jobs you‚Äôve applied to.

Also, if there's a specific company you want to work for, go directly to their website! Some companies allow you to make an account to keep a profile active for their recruiters, or let you set up notifications for new job postings.

Good luck on your learning journey and/or job hunt! If you learn some new skills from this or get any of the above jobs, I am so happy for you!!! üòä
